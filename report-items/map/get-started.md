## Adding the Map

Depending on the Report Designer tool you are using, the map provides the following approaches for including it in your report:
 
* [Adding the Map with the Map Wizard of the Standalone Report Designer](#using-the-standalone-report-designer)
* [Adding the Map with the Visual Studio Report Designer](#using-the-visual-studio-report-designer)

### Using the Standalone Report Designer

To add a Map item to your report in the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}), use the ribbon tools:

1. From the ribbon bar, open the **Insert** tab and select the Map item. As a result, the map Wizard will open.
1. Follow the steps indicated by the Map Wizard.
1. When you finish with the prompts, a new Map report item will appear on the design surface. The Map item will be rendered with the real data and its initial extent will depend on the data you are using. 

### Using the Visual Studio Designer

To add a Map item to your report in the [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}), run the Map Wizard: 

1. Open the Visual Studio toolbox. From the **Telerik Reporting** tab, select **Map Wizard**.
1. Click the design surface where you want to position the upper-left corner of the Map. As a result, the Map Wizard will open. 
1. Follow the steps indicated by the Map Wizard.
1. When you finish with the prompts, a new Map report item will appear on the design surface. The Map item will be rendered with the real data and its initial extent will depend on the data you are using.
