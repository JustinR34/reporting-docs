# Table/Crosstab Wizard



This wizard guides you through the process of adding a Table or a Crosstab item to a report that you created with the
        Telerik Web Report Designer.
        To invoke the wizard, click on the 
*Table Wizard
* or 
*Crosstab Wizard
* item in the toolbox.
        As a result, a new tab will appear on the right-hand side of the Web Report Designer.
      


## Wizard Structure

1. __Data
__

* __Data Source
__ - it is required to select a data source that will be used to fetch data for the Table or the Crosstab. If no data sources
                  are present in the report, you will need to create one before starting the wizard.
                


* __Data Source Fields
__ - the data fields of the selected data source will be listed here. Drag and drop the fields to the
                  
__Fields Arrangement
__ section to configure your Table/Crosstab.

__

* __Column Groups
__ - drag data source fields and drop them here to set up the column group hierarchy (available only in the Crosstab Wizard).

In the Crosstab Wizard, you can use the context menu on each dragged item to select an appropriate aggregate function
                  that will be used to display the row/column group subtotals and grand totals.

* __Layout
__ - there are four different layouts to select from (available only in the Crosstab Wizard).
