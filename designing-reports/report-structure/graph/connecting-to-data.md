# Connecting to Data



The Graph item is a data item and similar to the 
[Table]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table/crosstab/list/overview%})
 item it allows developers 
      to summarize data by two dimensions (
__CategoryGroups
__ hierarchy and 
__SeriesGroups
__ hierarchy) and 
      display one or more measures (depending on the series type). Like the other data items the Graph item connects to a single data source and provides 
      additional options for sorting and filtering the input data, binding, conditional formatting, etc.


It is important to carefully prepare and understand your data before you create a graph, as this will help you design your charts quickly and 
      efficiently.


## Similarities to the Table Item

One way to think about how a Graph item works is to compare it to a Table item:
  
  ![Table Comparison](images/DataItems/Graph/TableComparison.png)  
  ![Graph Comparison](images/DataItems/Graph/GraphComparison.png)

Conceptually, they both use the same multidimensional data model:


* The 
__ColumnGroups
__ in the 
__Table
__ are identical to the 
__CategoryGroups
__ of the 
__Graph
__.


* The 
__RowGroups
__ in the 
__Table
__ are identical to the 
__SeriesGroups
__ of the 
__Graph
__.


* The 
__Cells
__ in the 
__Table
__â€™s body definition are identical to the 
__Series
__ definitions of the 
__Graph
__.


## Category group hierarchy

The CategoryGroups hierarchy defines the data points in the Graph series. For example, suppose you have a group by product categories in the CategoryGroups hierarchy. The number of different categories will determine how many data points the series will have at runtime. If the product categories consist of 'Accessories', 'Bikes', 'Components' and 'Clothing' categories, the series in the Graph will have four data points.
      	


## Series group hierarchy

The SeriesGroups hierarchy defines the series at runtime. For example, suppose you have a group by the Year field in the SeriesGroups hierarchy. The number of different years will determine how many series will appear on the Graph. If the Year field contains the years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, the Graph will display four series for every series definition bound to this group.
      	


## Series Data

The Graph item series displays aggregated data to visualize one or more measures. At runtime the intersection between the series group hierarchy members and the category group hierarchy members defines the data points in the series. For each data point one or more aggregate functions are calculated to define the value/coordinates of the data points.
        


Depending on the series type the Graph item can visualize one or more measures:


* __Bar
__, 
__Area
__ series including all derived subtypes (Pie, Doughnut, Bar, Column, etc.) represent single measures;


* Range series (Range Bar and Range Area) emphasize on the distance between two values/measures;


* __Line
__ series including all derived subtypes (Scatter, etc.) allows to identify the correlation between three different measures.
