# How to Connect to MySQL Database



You can use the SqlDataSource component to connect to MySQL 
      database. Prior to this, you should install .NET connector. You need access 
      rights to a MySQL Server database with relevant server and authentication 
      information. Then, you can use the SqlDataSource component to provide data 
      to data items (Report, Table, Chart).
To use the SqlDataSource control to connect to MySql database


In Microsoft Visual Studio, open a Telerik Report. From the 
            Telerik Reporting 
{{site.suiteversion
}} group in the Toolbox, select the 
            SqlDataSource component and click on the design surface to add it 
            to the Report.
