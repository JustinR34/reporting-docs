# How to Connect to an Access Database



You can connect to a Microsoft Access database using the Telerik 
      SqlDataSource component. To do this, you need a connection string and an 
      Access data file. Then, you can use the SqlDataSource component to provide 
      data to data items (Report, Table, Chart).To connect to an Access database using the SqlDataSource control

In Microsoft Visual Studio, open a Telerik Report. From the 
            Telerik Reporting suiteversion group in the Toolbox, select the 
            SqlDataSource component and click on the design surface to add it 
            to the Report.

__Choose your Data Connection__ dialog box 
            appears.

Click __New Connection__If the __Change Data Source__ dialog box appears, click 
            __Microsoft Access Database File__, and then click __Continue__.

In the __Add Connection__ dialog box, 
            click __Change__, in the __Change
            Data Sourc__e dialog box, click __Microsoft 
            Access Database File__, and
            then click OK.

In the __Database file name__ box, enter a path to the Access database,
            and then under __Log on to the database__, enter your logon credentials, 
            if they are required.

Optionally, click __Test connection__ to 
            verify that the connection to the Access database succeeds.

Click __OK__ and notice that in the __Data Connection__ - 
            <Datasourcename> combobox, your new connection is selected.

Click __Next__ and Select the 
            __Yes, save this connectionâ€¦__ check box,
            enter a name for your connection for when the connection is stored in 
            the application configuration file, and then click __Next__.

Select the database table from which to retrieve results or enter your own SQL 
            statement.

To test your query, click __Next__, and then
            click __Execute Query__

Click __Finish__. The Wizard would close and the SqlDataSource 
            component would be ready for usage by the data items.

>note Parametrized Access Queries (stored procedures) are not supported, because 	the OLE DB provider cannot retrieve the procedures' parameter information.
