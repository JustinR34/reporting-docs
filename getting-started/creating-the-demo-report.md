# Creating the Demo Report



This article is part of the Demo report guide on getting started with Telerik Reporting and demonstrates how to create a new report.
      

## 

1. Navigate to the installation folder. For example, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting R1 2019\Report Designer`.
            

1. Run the Standalone Designer (`Telerik.ReportDesigner.exe`).
            

1. Click __New__ > __Blank Report__ and choose a destination for saving the report.
            Each newly created report renders the __pageHeaderSection__, __detailSection__,
              __pageFooterSection__ sections.
              The report also provides the __Report Header__ and __Report Footer__ sections which are hidden by default.
